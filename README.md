Ranther  is a great way to start a conversation, and this repo makes it easy to do just that. Simply press the button, and you'll see a random "Would you rather" question. The question are generated by IA,  so you'll never run out of this kind of question. You can use these questions to start a conversation, break the ice, or just have some fun!

🕣 May <strong>take a little while</strong> because I'm using <strong>co:here</strong> free trial API key. <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Get yours!</a>

## 👇 Disclaimer
I tried to ask for generic and not invasive or too personal question, but if a question make you feel uncomfortable, I apologize in advance, it not was my intention. This is a fun and non pretentious project.
