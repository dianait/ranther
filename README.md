Ranther  is a great way to start a conversation, and this repo makes it easy to do just that. Simply press the button, and you'll see a random "Would you rather" question. The question are generated by IA,  so you'll never run out of this kind of question. You can use these questions to start a conversation, break the ice, or just have some fun!
